Finally, in addition to these solo projects and in addition to my work for Codecademy and Pivotal Labs, I've worked on freelance projects with a group at Stanford (Rails/JS App developed with TDD, called "Crowd Consensus" - available at https://crowdconsensus.herokuapp.com/) and Tribeca Film Festival (www.tribecafilm.com - large codebase, Rails/JS/Mongo), among others. I do this through a web development shop that I run, called Qualia Studios: http://www.meetqualia.com/.
