###YLS Class Action.
The first project I ever made. Better course selection for Yale Law School students. Admittedly, not proud of the code, but is my most popular project to date (from a user count perspective)! (Rails, jQuery).

###Game of Life, in Clojure.
Dinky but somewhat clean implementation of Conway's Game of Life, from when I was learning basic Clojure during Summer 2013.

Finally, in addition to these solo projects and in addition to my work for Codecademy and Pivotal Labs, I've worked on freelance projects: (1) with a group at Stanford on a project called [Crowd Consensus](https://crowdconsensus.herokuapp.com/) (Rails/JS App developed with TDD) and (2) [Tribeca Film Festival](www.tribecafilm.com) (Rails/JS/Mongo), among others. I do this through a web development shop that I run, called [Qualia Studios](http://www.meetqualia.com).
